            "I received a job offer mid-course, and stepping into the working
            world felt like crossing the threshold from the enchanting realm of
            Harry Potter into the ordinary realm of Muggles. However, to my
            surprise, the subjects I had learned in my studies were not only
            relevant but even more cutting-edge in the company I joined. It was
            as if I had brought a piece of the magical world with me, and I
            couldn't help but feel that I had truly received every penny's worth
            of my education."

            "I was an living in basement for many years before I joined the
            Hogwarts. Intrigued and with gold coins my parents left me, I
            decided to dip my toes in the magical waters by signing up for the
            free intro course. And now, since completing the course, I have
            successfully made the transition. It feels like I've entered a
            parallel universe where lines of code hold the power to create
            wonders. The junior year was my very own Hogwarts, where I
            discovered my true potential and unlocked the door to a world of
            endless possibilities. I am forever grateful for the transformative
            experience that has allowed me to wield the magic of programming and
            embark on a new journey in the realm of technology."
