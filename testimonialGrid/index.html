            "I received a job offer mid-course, and stepping into the working
            world felt like crossing the threshold from the enchanting realm of
            Harry Potter into the ordinary realm of Muggles. However, to my
            surprise, the subjects I had learned in my studies were not only
            relevant but even more cutting-edge in the company I joined. It was
            as if I had brought a piece of the magical world with me, and I
            couldn't help but feel that I had truly received every penny's worth
            of my education."

            Hogwarts. Intrigued and with gold coins my parents left me, I
            decided to dip my toes in the magical waters by signing up for the
            free intro course. And now, since completing the course, I have
            successfully made the transition. It feels like I've entered a
            parallel universe where lines of code hold the power to create
            wonders. The junior year was my very own Hogwarts, where I
            discovered my true potential and unlocked the door to a world of
            endless possibilities. I am forever grateful for the transformative
            experience that has allowed me to wield the magic of programming and
            embark on a new journey in the realm of technology. Ms-Excel rocks!!

            "Before joining the Hogwarts, they thought I've never written a line
            of magic code. Oh boy! they were wrong. Hogwarts passouts have magic
            but us muggles we have knife in london. Moreover, I visited my
            cousin in USA and bought/taught myself guns. Boy! hogwarts magic
            were no match for it. In fact, I've often referred to it during
            interviews as an example of my both world experience. It certainly
            helped me land a job as a Howgarts Principle after receiving
            multiple offers. <br />100% recommend! <br />Also learn some guns
            magic from likes of USA cousins. It will help like silver bullets
            dip in holy water for Vamps if your magic wand is broken. Best of
            both worlds!
            <br />
            Some magic to you muggles who like to be in Hogwarts.<br />
            Although it may not have the same effect in the Muggle world as it
            does in the wizarding world, I can guide you through the incantation
            and technique.
            <br />1. First, stand in a comfortable position with your feet
            shoulder-width apart. Imagine the object you want to levitate in
            front of you. It could be a small item like a feather or a pencil to
            start with.<br />2. Extend your arm, pointing your wand or imaginary
            wand towards the object. Focus your mind on the concept of
            levitation, envisioning the object floating in the air.<br />3. Now,
            with confidence and a clear pronunciation, say the incantation,
            "Wingardium Leviosa." Remember to emphasize the "gar" syllable.<br />4.
            As you pronounce the incantation, make a swishing motion with your
            wand or your hand, as if flicking it upwards. <br />5. Imagine a
            gentle upward force lifting the object, defying gravity.<br />
            While it's important to note that this spell won't actually levitate
            objects in the Muggle world, it can be a fun way to embrace your
            inner Hermione Granger and engage in imaginative play. Remember, the
            true magic lies in the power of your imagination and creativity.
            Now, go ahead and give it a try! "Wingardium Leviosa!"
